    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>
      Functions arise whenever one quantity depends upon the other.
      Calculus is the mathematics that describes changes in functions.
      Therefore before we start learning calculus,
      we need to have a thorough knowledge of the functions that we will see in the real-world application problems in calculus.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this chapter,
      we will review some of the functions that you will see in calculus like polynomial, power,
      rational, trigonometric, exponential,
      logarithmic functions, and piece-wise defined functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will learn how to evaluate functions and how to find their domain and range.
      We will also discuss the properties of their graphs and will provide examples of equations with terms involving these functions.
      In short, this chapter provides the foundation for the material to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will be using graphing utilities like Desmos or Geogebra in the examples and activities of this book.
      The use of these devices will enable us to visualize and analyze the graph of complicated functions and study complex problems.

    <title>Function definition and notation</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          : A function is a relation that relates an input to one and only one output.
          The set of inputs is called the domain of function and the set of outputs is called the range of the function.
          The modern definition of function was first given in 1837 by the German mathematician Peter Dirichlet.
          The following representation of a function is called an arrow diagram.
          Set A is called the set of input or the domain of the function and set B is called the set of output or the range of the function.

      <em>Function notation</em>: An example of a function notation is <m>y=f(x)</m> and is read as <m>y</m> is equal to <m>f</m> of <m>x</m> meaning <m>f</m> is a function of <m>x</m> or <m>f</m> depends upon <m>x</m>.
      Here <m>x</m> is the independent variable and <m>y</m> is the dependent variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another example is <m>x=g(t)</m> is read as <m>x</m> is equal to <m>g</m> of <m>t</m> means <m>g</m> is a function of <m>t</m>.
      Here <m>t</m> is the independent variable and <m>x</m> is the dependent variable.
    </p>
    <example>

            <p>
              A model to find the basal metabolism rate,
              in kcal/h, of a young man is given by
              <me>
                R(t)=85-0.18\cos(\frac{\pi t}{12})
              </me>.
              Where <m>t</m> is the time in hours measured from <m>5</m> am.Here <m>R(5)</m> represents the basal metabolism rate,
              in kcal/h, of a young man at 10 am.

              The birth rate and the death rate of a population in people per year are given by
              <m>b(t)=1241e^{0.0197t}</m> and <m>d(t)=682e^{0.008t}</m> respectively.
              The area between these curves for
              <m>0 \leq t \leq 15</m> represents the increase in population over 15 year period.

    <p>
      <em>Domain and range of functions</em>: The domain of a function <m>f(x)</m> is the set of input at which the function <m>f(x)</m> is defined.
      The domain of a function can vary,
      depending on whether the function is complex-valued, real-valued, etc.
      Values of <m>x</m> in a domain are not repeated meaning a given input has only one output.
      The range of a function is the set of all possible outputs of the function corresponding to the allowed inputs.

    <title>Various ways to represent and write functions</title>
    <p>
      <em>Function representation</em>: We can represent different types of functions in different ways.
      Usually, functions are represented using formulas or graphs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are four ways the representation of a function as given below:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Algebraic Representation</em>: Egyptian, Chinese,
            and Babylonian engineers knew how the area of a square scales with the length of its side.
            They knew that it was possible to store nine times more bales of hay if the side of the square loft was tripled.
            They also found out how to calculate the area of more complex designs like rectangles T-shapes and so on.
            However, they didn't know how to calculate the sides of the shapes - the length of the sides,
            starting from a given area.
            Area <m>A</m> of the square depends upon its side length <m>s</m>.
            The rule that connects  <m>s</m> and <m>A</m> is given by the equation.
            <me>
              A=s^2
            </me>
            and we say that <m>A</m> is a function of <m>s</m>.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <em>Pros</em>: Shorthand Rule
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <em>Cons</em>: Less intuitive
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Graphical Representation</em>: Often a graph is the best way to represent a function because it conveys so much information at a glance.
            Just like electrocardiograms are graphs that enable cardiologists to diagnose possible problems.
            It measures electric potential <m>V</m> (Millivolts) as a function of time <m>t</m>.

      <em>Various ways of writing functions</em> Explicit, implicit,
      and parametric relations Explicitly defined functions are what we have been working with so far that is,
      <m>y = f(x)</m>.
      The ordered pair <m>(x, y)</m> is obtained easily as <m>(x, f(x))</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is defined as an implicit function when there is no separation of dependent and independent variables.
      A rule which may not be a function can still define a relation.
      For example, consider the rule
      <me>
        x^2+y^2=100
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This defines a set of ordered pairs <m>(x,y)</m> which we can sketch.
    </p>

</latex-image>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This relation does not, however,
      define a function, since the sketch will fail the vertical line test.
      However, we can always break a relation like this up into many parts which will pass the vertical line test,
      and these many parts will then be functions.
      The following are examples of explicit functions.
      <me>
        y=\sqrt{100-x^2}
      </me>
      and

      A third way of defining relations is parametric which is a different way of writing functions,
      just like explicit and implicit forms.
      In this case,
      the ordered pair <m>(x, y)</m> is defined in terms of the third variable called the parameter.
      Here that parameter is <m>t</m>,
      such as <m>x = t + 1, y = t^2+2t</m> This third variable controls the two variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For different values of the parameter <m>t</m>,
      we get different ordered pairs <m>(x, y)</m>.

      <title>Polynomial functions</title>
      <p>
        The word polynomial joins two diverse roots:
        the Greek poly, meaning "many", and the Latin nomen,
        or "name". It was derived from the term binomial by replacing the Latin root bi- with the Greek poly-. That is,
        it means a sum of many terms

            Polynomials arise naturally in the study of problems involving the volume and surface area of three-dimensional containers such as boxes and cylinders because these formulas fundamentally involve sums and products of variables.
            For instance,
            the volume of cylinder <m>V</m> with height <m>h</m>,
            and radius <m>r</m>, <m>V=\pi r^2 h</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The surface area is given by
            <me>
              A=2\pi  r^2+2\pi  r  h
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            If the surface area is 1000 square units.
            Then
            <me>
              2\pi  r^2+2\pi  r  h=1000
            </me>
            <me>
              2\pi r  h=1000-2\pi  r^2
            </me>
            <me>
              h=\frac{1000-2\pi  r^2}{2\pi  r}
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            So the volume becomes
            <me>
              V=\pi  r^2  (\frac{1000-2\pi  r^2}{2\pi r})
            </me>
            <me>
              V(r)=r(500-\pi  r^2)=500r-\pi r^3
            </me>
            which is a cubic polynomial.

        Where <m>C</m> is a constant There are many situations,
        that involve constant change over time.
        A constant function is a specific type of mathematical function that,
        as its name suggests,
        outputs will always be the same value for any input.
        In other words,
        the output of a constant function remains constant.
        This is why it is called a constant function.
        The graph of a constant function is a horizontal line parallel to the <m>x</m> axis.

        the vertex is the minimum point of the parabola and if it is negative then it is a down-facing parabola and the vertex is the maximum point of the parabola.
        Parabola is one of the types of conic sections credited to having been discovered by Menaechmus.

      <title>Power functions</title>
      <p>
        Power functions appear in many places in calculus,
        for example when we have questions related to circles and spheres we see power functions there.
      </p>
      <definition>
        <statement>
          <p>
            A power function is a function with a single term that is the product of a real number,
            a coefficient,
            and a variable raised to a fixed real number and is of the form
            <me>
              f(x)=kx^p
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            Where <m>k</m> and <m>p</m> are real numbers and <m>k\neq 0</m> is also known as the coefficient.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>
      <p>
        We consider several cases of power functions.
        <m>p=n</m> where <m>n</m> is a positive integer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The examples and graphs of
        <m>f(x)=x^n</m> for <m>n=3</m> and <m>4</m> are given below.

            When blood flows along a blood vessel, the flux
            (the volume of blood per unit of time that flows past a given point)
            is proportional to the fourth power of the radius <m>R</m> of the blood vessel:
            <me>
              F=kR^4

          <p>
            (This is known as Poiseuille's Law) A partially clogged artery can be expanded by an operation called angioplasty,
            in which a balloon-tipped catheter is inflated inside the artery to widen it and restore normal blood flow.
            A 5 percent increase in the radius will benefit the patient because a 5 percent increase in the radius corresponds to a 20 percent increase in blood flow.

        <em>Domain of root functions</em>
        To find the domain of root functions,
        we are going to use the fact that the even root of negative numbers is non-real but the odd root of negative numbers is real-valued.

          <p>
            Since this is a square root function.
            So the domain of this function is all real numbers except the values of <m>x</m> which makes the radicand negative.
            <me>
              x-4\geq 0

            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            So the domain of this function is is

            The function in the denominator is a square root function.

      <title>Algebraic functions</title>
      <p>
        Algebraic functions are built from the finite combinations of the basic algebraic operations:
        addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
        and raising to constant powers.
        Examples include power, polynomial,
        rational, and root functions.
        The graphs of an algebraic function can assume a variety of shapes.

        Transcendental, in math, means
        <q>non-algebraic</q>. These functions
        <q>transcend</q>
        the usual rules of algebra
        (transcend means to
        <q>go beyond the range or limits of…</q>).
        Transcendental was first defined by Euler in his Introductio (1748) as functions not definable by the
        <q>ordinary operations of algebra</q>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples include logarithmic,

        <m>b \neq 1</m> , <m>b > 1</m> , <m>x</m> is the exponent and is a real number.
        Its ubiquitous occurrence in pure and applied mathematics led mathematician Walter Rudin to consider the exponential function to be "the most important function in mathematics".

        <em>Domain of exponential functions</em>

        <em>Existence of inverse function</em>:
      </p>
      <p>
        For a function to have an inverse or in other words,
        a function is invertible if it is a one-to-one function.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>One-to-one function</em>:
      </p>
      <p>
        A one-to-one function is a particular type of function in which for each output value <m>y</m> there is exactly one input value <m>x</m> that is associated with it.
        In other words,
        a function is one-to-one if each output <m>y</m> corresponds to precisely one input <m>x</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Identifying one-to-one function graphically</em>:
      </p>
      <p>
        There is an easy graphical way to figure out if a function is an invertible function, This test is called a horizontal line test.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A Horizontal line test</em>:
      </p>
      <p>
        When examining a graph of a function, if a horizontal line
        (which represents a single value for <m>y</m>),
        intersects the graph of a function in more than one place,
        then for each point of intersection,
        you have a different value of <m>x</m> associated with the same value of <m>y</m>.
        Thus the <m>y</m> value does not correspond to just precisely one input,
        and the graph is not that of a one-to-one function.
        This is the idea behind the Horizontal Line Test.
      </p>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            A function <m>x^2+y^2=1</m> is not an invertible function.
            Since its graph is a circle it fails the horizontal line test.
            If you draw a horizontal line say <m>x=0</m>,
            it will intersect the circle at two points,
            <m>y=-1</m> and <m>y=1</m>.

        Logarithms were discovered in the 16th century by John Napier,
        a Scottish mathematician, scientist, and astronomer.
        It is an important medium for math calculations.

        \item <em>Trigonometric functions</em>: The term "trigonometry" was derived from the Greek trigōnon, "triangle" and metron, "measure". Early study of triangles can be traced to the 2nd millennium BC, in Egyptian mathematics (Rhind Mathematical Papyrus) and Babylonian mathematics.
        The trigonometric functions
        (also called circular functions, or angle functions),
        are real functions that relate the angle of a right-angled triangle to ratios of two side lengths.
        They are widely used in all sciences that are related to geometry,
        such as navigation,
        solid mechanics, celestial mechanics, geodesy, and many others.
        They are among the simplest periodic functions,
        and as such are also widely used for studying periodic phenomena through Fourier analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        The trigonometric functions most widely used in modern mathematics are the sine,
        the cosine, and the tangent.
        Their reciprocals are the cosecant, the secant,
        and the cotangent respectively, which are less used.
        Each of these six trigonometric functions has a corresponding inverse function.
        We will discuss trigonometric functions and their inverses in more detail in Chapter 4.

        <statement>

            A model for the amount of blood in the heart <m>V(t)</m> measured in milliliters is given by
            <m>V(t)=35\cos(\frac{5\pi t}{3})+105</m>, Where <m>t</m> is measured in seconds since the heart was full.

    <title>Piece-wise defined functions</title>
    <p>
      : It is a way of expressing functions.
      A function is defined by multiple sub-functions,
      where each sub-function applies to a different interval in the domain.
      <men>
        f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{lr} \textbf{function 1}, \amp  \text{ if }  x \in \text{ Domain 1 } \\ \textbf{function 2}, \amp  \text{ if }   x \in \text{ Domain 2 }  \\ \textbf{function 3}, \amp  \text{ if }   x \in \text{ Domain 3 }  \end{array} \right\}

      <statement>
        <p>
          The examples of piecewise-defined functions involve absolute value functions,
          floor, and ceiling functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Absolute value function</em>
          The absolute value function is a function of the form
          <me>
            f(x)=|x|
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1806, Jean-Robert Argand introduced the term module,
          meaning unit of measure in French,
          specifically for the complex absolute value,
          and it was borrowed into English in 1866 as the Latin equivalent of modulus.
          The term absolute value has been used in this sense from at least 1806 in French and 1857 in English.
          The notation <m>|x|</m>,
          with a vertical bar on each side,
          was introduced by Karl Weierstrass in 1841.
          Other names for absolute value include numerical value and magnitude.

      <em>Floor and ceiling functions</em>
      In mathematics and computer science,
      the floor function is the function that takes as input a real number <m>x</m> and gives as output the greatest integer less than or equal to <m>x</m>,
      denoted <m>\lfloor x \rfloor</m> or
      <em>floor</em><m>(x)</m>.
      Similarly, the ceiling function maps <m>x</m> to the least integer greater than or equal to <m>x</m>,
      denoted <m>\lceil x \rceil</m> or
      <em>ceil</em><m>(x)</m>.

        Calculus I and Calculus II, are single-variable calculus.
        This means we mostly deal with the functions of only one variable.
        However, in some applications,
        we come across functions of two variables.
        Since we only know how to differentiate and integrate the functions of a single variable,
        we need to convert the functions of two variables into the functions of a single variable.

    <title>Special features and attributes of functions</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Have you ever thought about why roller coasters are so fascinating?
        From the first Russian ice slides in the 17th century to the modern-day steel coasters,
        the thrill of the ride has captivated people of all ages.
        To accurately model every component of roller coaster design,
        calculus is needed.
        Calculus helps engineers understand the rate of change,
        analyze curves, loops,
        and twists along the roller coaster track,
        and optimize the ride experience.
        The designers can create curves, twists,
        and turns that maximize the thrill while maintaining rider safety.
        It also helps with slope calculations and finds the maximum and minimum points along the track.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here we will discuss some special features of functions.
        The features like where the functions increase and decrease,
        have maxima,
        and minima,
        are concave up, and concave down,
        and have inflection points.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we will understand and discuss some special features of the functions like the intervals where functions increase and decrease,
        concave up, and concave down,
        the points where functions have maxima and minima, and inflection points.
        We will approximate these features by graphing utility or by algebra.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later in calculus,
        we will find all these special features by the methods of calculus.

      <title>Symmetry</title>

        If a function <m>f</m> satisfies
        <m>f(-x)=f(x)</m> for every number <m>x</m> in its domain,
        then <m>f</m> is called an even function.
        For instance, the function <m>f(x)=x^2</m> is even because
        <me>
          f(-x)=(-x)^2=x^2=f(x)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The geometrical significance of an even function is that its graph is symmetrical with respect to the <m>y</m> axis.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a function <m>f</m> satisfies
        <m>f(-x)=-f(x)</m> for every number <m>x</m> in its domain,
        then <m>f</m> is called an odd function.
        For instance, the function <m>f(x)=x^3</m> is even because
        <me>
          f(-x)=(-x)^3=-x^3=-f(x)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The geometrical significance of an even function is that its graph is symmetrical with respect to the origin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some functions are neither even nor odd.
        For instance For instance, the function <m>f(x)=x-x^2</m> because
        <me>
          f(-x)=(-x-(-x^2))=-x-x^2
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>

      <title>Extremum</title>
      <p>
        Some functions have "hills and valleys": places where they reach a minimum or maximum value.
        Maxima and minima are known as the extrema of a function within the given set of ranges.
        For a function, under the entire range,
        the maximum value of the function is known as the absolute maxima,
        and the minimum value is known as the absolute minima when we are considering the entire domain of the function.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are other maxima and minima of a function,
        that are not the absolute maxima and minima of the function and are known as local maxima and local minima.
        Let us learn more about local maxima and minima,
        absolute maxima and minima,
        and how to find them by using the graphing utility.
        Later on, we will find them by using calculus methods.

      <title>Sharp corners, cusps, and vertical tangents</title>
      <p>
        Sharp corners and cusps in a graph are the sharp turning points.
        The slopes on either side of the sharp corners do not equal each other.
        A vertical tangent line has no sharp corners,
        but the slopes on either side approach infinity or negative infinity.
        The tangent line exists, but it is vertical.
        A cusp is a point where two branches of the curve meet and the tangents of each branch are equal.

      <p>
        A hole in a rational function is a result of it sharing common factors by numerator and denominator.

        <em>Asymptote</em>: The word asymptote is derived from the Greek (asumptōtos) which means "not falling together".The term was introduced by Apollonius of Perga in his work on conic sections.
        An asymptote of a curve is a line such that the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero as one or both of the <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> coordinates tend to infinity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Asymptotes have a variety of applications,
        they are simple approximations to complex equations,
        and they are useful for graphing rational functions.

        <em>Horizontal vs. vertical asymptotes</em>
        While both horizontal and vertical asymptotes help describe the behavior of a function at its extremities,
        it is worth noting that they do have some differences.
        One of the key differences is that a function can only have a maximum of 2 horizontal asymptotes.
        We can see why by considering how we find horizontal asymptotes by examining the limit of a function as it approaches infinity
        (or <m>-\infty</m>).
        Since there are only two directions we can consider, infinity
        (or <m>-\infty</m> ),
        there can only be, at maximum, 2 horizontal asymptotes.
        In contrast,
        a function can have any number of vertical asymptotes.
        The tangent function, for example,
        has an infinite number of vertical asymptotes.
      </p>
      <definition>
        <statement>
          <p>
            <em>Oblique asymptote</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Oblique asymptotes are also known as slanted asymptotes.
            That's because of its slanted form representing a linear function graph,
            <me>
              y=mx+b
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            A rational function may only contain an oblique asymptote when its numerator's degree is exactly one degree higher than its denominator's degree.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oblique asymptotes are the linear functions that we can use to predict a rational function's end behavior,
            as shown by our example below.

                  We let <m>g(x)=0</m> and solve for <m>x</m>.
                  Say we get <m>x=a</m>.
                  That of the vertical asymptote of the function.
                  Here set the denominator equal to zero.

      <title>Continuity</title>
      <p>
        Continuity was introduced by Cauchy in 1821 in his famous textbook Cours d'Analyse.
        A continuous function is one whose values change smoothly,
        with no jumps or gaps in the graph.
        We'll explore the idea first,
        and arrive at a mathematical definition soon.
        In easy words,
        we can just say that a function is continuous at a fixed point if we can draw the graph of the function around that point without lifting the pen from the paper's plane.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will be learning a more formal definition of the continuity of a function in calculus.

      <title>End behavior</title>
      <p>
        The end behavior of a function <m>f(x)</m> refers to how the function behaves when the variable <m>x</m> increases or decreases without bounds.
        Which means <m>x</m> is approaching to the <m>\infty</m> or -<m>\infty</m>.
        The study of the end behavior which is also called the steady state of a system or the long-time behavior of a function has tremendous applications in real-life situations.
      </p>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Use Desmos to check the graph of the exponential growth function
            <m>f(x)=e^x</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>\infty</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The function <m>f(x)=e^x</m> goes to <m>\infty</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>\infty</m> and the function goes to zero as <m>x</m> approaches <m>-\infty</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the graph of the exponential decay function
            <m>f(x)=e^{-x}</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>\infty</m> the function goes to zero,
            and as <m>x</m> approaches <m>-\infty</m> the function goes to <m>\infty</m>.
