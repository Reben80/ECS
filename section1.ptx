      As you are transitioning from algebra to calculus,
      we would like you to understand what calculus is,
      how it was developed by various mathematicians,
      and how calculus problems differ from algebra problems.
      Introduction and understanding of the terms infinity and infinitesimal will help you understand the key concept of calculus.
      We will end this chapter by looking at some of the applications of calculus in daily life that you will explore in more detail in calculus.

    <title>What is calculus?</title>
    <p>
      Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with the rate of change.
      The word calculus means ‘small pebble' in Latin,
      and is named after the rocks used by the Romans for counting because it is like understanding something very small pieces.
      Calculus has two main branches:
      differential calculus, and integral calculus.
      One branch, differential calculus cuts something into small pieces to find how it changes:
      the other branch integral calculus,
      joins the small pieces together to find how much total there is.
      These two branches are connected by the fundamental theorem of calculus.

    <title>A glimpse into calculus</title>
    <p>
      Suppose we are driving a car.
      Let <m>v(t)</m> represent the car's velocity in miles per hour,
      and <m>s(t)</m> represent the total distance traveled by the vehicle in miles,
      where <m>t</m> is the time in hours.
      Now we have two questions about the relationship between the total distance traveled by the car and the velocity of the vehicle.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            How to find the velocity of the car at any time if we know the total distance traveled by the car at various times?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            How to find the total distance traveled by car if we know the velocity of the car?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's consider a scenario.
      Suppose that the velocity of the car is a constant and positive <m>20</m> mph so <m>v(t)=20</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we know the velocity is the rate of change of distance.
      If velocity is constant,
      that means the rate of change of distance is constant.
      So the distance is changing linearly at a constant rate of <m>20</m> miles per hour and can be represented by the function
      <me>
        s(t)=20t
      </me>
      and the graph of the distance function <m>s(t)</m> will be a line with the slope 20.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opposite is also true.
      When the distance increases linearly, velocity is constant.

    <p>
      The area under the velocity curve over an interval of time tells us the total distance the car traveled.
      Why?
      Because when the velocity is constant,
      the region under the graph is a rectangle.
      Its height is <m>v</m>, its width is <m>t</m>, and so its area is
      <me>
        A=vt
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this problem <m>v=20</m> and <m>t=8-2=6</m>.
      The area under the velocity curve between <m>t=2</m> and <m>t=8</m> is
      <me>
        A=20\enspace\frac{\mbox{miles} }{\mbox{\cancel{hour}} }\cdot\enspace{6} \enspace\mbox{\cancel{hour}} =120 \enspace\mbox{miles}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      So we found the total distance travelled by the car using the velocity function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let's look at the graph of the distance function, it is a straight line.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we know the slope of a line is equal to the change in <m>y</m> divided by the change in <m>x</m>,
      or rise over run.
      <me>
        \mbox{The slope of this line}  =\frac{\mbox{change in \(y\)} }{\mbox{change in \(x\)} }= \frac{\mbox{change in distance} }{\mbox{change in time} }
      </me>
      <me>
        \mbox{Slope} =\frac{v \cancel{t}}{\cancel{t}}=v
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, we observe that the total distance traveled
      <me>
        s(t)=20t
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      \mbox{between} <m>t=2</m> \mbox{and} <m>t=8</m> \mbox{is}
      <me>
        s(8)-s(2)=160-40=120
      </me>
      miles Now you try,
    </p>
    <p>
      https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ima2wusvt9
    </p>
    <p>
      Geometrically, the velocity is the slope of the distance graph.
      Next, we make the conjecture:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            The slope of the distance graph gives the velocity.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The area under the velocity graph gives the distance.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <remark>
      <p>
        We were able to find the velocity from the distance and vice versa easily by using geometry.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
        If the velocity is negative,
        a moving object is traveling in the opposite direction or backtracking.
        To determine the distance traveled,
        we have to compute the distance separately on intervals where velocity is positive or negative and account for the change in position on each such interval.
      </p>
    </remark>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Why do we need calculus?</title>
    <p>
      In the above problem, what if the velocity is not constant?
      Then the area under the velocity curve is not a rectangle or other familiar figure that we can find the area of,
      and the graph of the distance is not a straight line, so what is its slope?
      How do we find the velocity from the distance and vice versa?
      For example, take a look at the picture below.

      To answer these questions we need more tools and we need to develop new skills,
      and that is what calculus does.
    </p>
    <p>
      The study says each year many students are enrolled in college-level calculus courses in the United States.
      Now the question is why all these students need to take calculus.
      To understand this we need to go back a little in history.
    </p>
    <p>
      It provides a way for us to construct relatively simple quantitative models of change,
      and to deduce their consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before calculus was invented,
      all mathematics was static.
      It could only help calculate objects that were perfectly still.
      But the universe is constantly moving and changing.
      No objects<ndash/>from the stars in space to subatomic particles or cells in the body<ndash/>are always at rest.
      Indeed, just about everything in the universe is constantly moving.
      Also, it is understood that all measurable phenomena can be represented by curves.
      Calculus helps us to study and analyze the properties of those curves and in turn determine how phenomena like particles, stars,
      and matter move and change in real time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides many ideas,
      calculus models how objects fall under the forces of gravity and wind resistance,
      explains how to compute areas and volumes of interesting shapes,
      enables us to work rigorously with infinitely small and infinitely large quantities,
      and connects the varying rates at which quantities change to the total change in the quantities themselves.

    <title>A brief history and development of calculus</title>
    <p>
      Calculus, also known in its early history,
      as infinitesimal calculus, developed over a long period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many elements of calculus appeared in ancient Egypt and Babylonia, Greece,
      then in China and the Middle East,
      and still later again in medieval Europe and India.
    </p>
    <p>
      The development of calculus and its uses within the sciences have continued to the present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will include the history of calculus and the contributions of other mathematicians to it throughout this book.

    <title>Calculus versus algebra</title>
    <p>
      The word "algebra" is derived from the Arabic word al-jabr,
      and this comes from the treatise written in the year 830 by the medieval Persian mathematician., Al-Khwārizmī.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathematics is an activity of investigation and exploration.
      Two of its branches algebra and calculus are important tools for understanding the world.
      While both branches provide powerful tools for studying mathematics they serve very different purposes.
      Whether it is shopping smarter or predicting trends with artificial intelligence,
      that's why we believe understanding the difference between algebra and calculus is key.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Algebra is the study of equations,
            inequalities, and functions.
            It focuses on manipulating numbers.
            Calculus is the study of continuous change and is used to analyze and model complex systems.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Algebra is a branch of mathematics that typically uses mathematical statements to represent relationships between various things,
            such as a relationship between the supply of an object and its price and calculus is a branch of mathematics that focuses on understanding how this relationship changes over time.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Algebra finds the value of a function at a point,
            the slope of a line, the average rate of change between two points,
            the height of a function at a certain point,
            and the direction of motion along a line.
            Calculus finds the value of a function as the independent variable approaches a certain point,
            the slope of a curve, the instantaneous rate of change at a point,
            the maximum height on an interval,
            and the direction of motion along any curve.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Infinity and infinitesimal</title>
    <p>
      There are some notions in calculus that anyone who studies it will learn about which are <em>infinity</em>
      and <em>infinitesimals</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In mathematics,
      infinity and infinitesimal are often used to describe the behavior of functions.
      For example, what is the end behavior of the function?
      What happens to a graph when it gets close to a certain point?
    </p>
    <p>
      An infinitesimal refers to a very small quantity but not zero! while infinity refers to a number bigger than any real number.
      The choice between these terms often depends on the specific problem being solved.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example,
      when calculating the slope of a tangent line of a function,
      an infinitesimal is often used to describe the change in the function as the independent variable approaches zero.
      On the other hand, when describing the end behavior of a function,
      infinity is often used to describe the value that the function approaches as the independent variable approaches positive or negative infinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The infinity symbol <m>\infty</m> was introduced by mathematician John Wallis in 1655.
      The word "infinity" comes from the Latin word infinitas,
      which means "boundless". Infinitesimals were introduced by Isaac Newton as a means of
      <q>explaining</q>
      his procedures in calculus.
      Before the behavior of the function near a certain point had been formally introduced and understood,
      it was not clear how to explain it or even if it worked.
      In essence, Newton treated an infinitesimal as a smaller positive number,
      somehow, than any positive real number.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many early attempts to explain calculus were based on questionable reasoning about infinitesimals.
      As a consequence,
      infinitesimal calculus was originally applied to differential and integral calculus.
      As rigorous definitions of limit, continuity,
      and real numbers were established,
      this terminology faded away.
      The infinitesimals of John Wallis differ from the indivisible in that he decomposes geometric figures into infinitely thin building blocks that are of the same dimension as that of the figure and prepares the basis of general methods of integral computations.
      Archimedes used infinitesimals which eventually came to be called the indivisible method to identify areas of regions and solid volumes by the method of exhaustion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The insight with the use of infinitesimals was that,
      although these entities were infinitely small,
      they could still retain certain specific properties such as angle or slope.
      Infinitesimals are a key ingredient in Leibniz's infinitesimal calculus procedures.
